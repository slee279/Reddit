This is my third installment of my weekly reddit post called 10 Things You Should Know, eventually to be shortened to 10TYSK. This week we're covering Aeon's End, a deck-building co-operative game by Kevin Riley, published by Action Phase Games and Indie Boards and Games. Each player acts as a mage trying to defeat an extremely powerful nemesis (think Cthulhu types) by casting spells into breaches to deal damage. If the nemesis' HP is drained or his/her deck is depleted before the nemesis destroys the mages or their city, the players win.

1. **If you love deckbuilding, but hate shuffling, this is the deckbuilder for you.** You never have to shuffle your deck, you just flip it over to restart it. This adds another layer of strategy as to how you arrange your discard pile to maximize your deck's efficiency and power.

2. **If you don't like deckbuilding, there isn't enough new game here to satisfy you.** I like to think of this game as a cross between Sentinels of the Multiverse and Big Book of Madness. If those games don't get you excited, this game probably won't either. However, I'm not a *huge* deck-builder guy in general, but this is my favorite one. I have also played Legendary Encounters Aliens, Marvel Legendary, Harry Potter Hogwarts Battle, Clank, Big Book of Madness, and Dominion. So I do have a little experience with the genre.

3. **Set up and take down are the worst parts of the game**, and eventually you may want to house rule the way you do this. Before each game you have to construct the deck for the nemesis, your individual starter decks, and you have to randomly build the market with 3 gems, 4 spells, and 2 relics. If you buy enough expansions, this will give a TON of options for each category. But you'll also eventually find that without certain types of gems, relics, spells, or player powers, winning a game is extremely difficult, if not impossible.

4. As with all co-op deckbuilders, **you may find some games more frustratingly difficult than others**. However, if you play co-op deck-builders, you probably already know this. Sometimes you just get a brutal combination of cards. This game doesn't suffer from Harry Potter-like problems where an opening villain combo means you just have to reshuffle before even attempting to beat them, but it can derail your game. The game does have built in tiers of card difficult like Legendary Aliens and Predator, so that helps.

5. **There are essentially two base games**: Aeon's End (AE) and War Eternal (WE). You can buy either one and have everything you need to play and add expansions to without buying the other. Buying both will give you double sets of only starter cards like sparks and crystal. Everything else will be unique, so if you want more variations in nemeses, nemeses base cards, spells, relics, or gems, go ahead and buy both.

5. **The artwork is nice, the insert is terrible**. If you love great inserts, you will find nothing of the kind in this game. It's cheap cardboard. I have organized my copies into two boxes, one with all the nemeses cards, and one with all the hero cards. The games do come with dividers to enable some quicker set up. What I've done since I have both AE and WE is use a label maker to further organize my cards into alphabetical groupings so I can find spells, relics, and gems even quicker.

6. **Each nemesis is different enough so games feel unique in terms of strategy and play**. They are not all beaten by buying the biggest baddest spells and pounding them into oblivion. With the more difficult level villains, you may find it takes you 2-3 tries to defeat them, and you may find yourself having to try different types of player powers and market cards to defeat them. This is where house ruling comes into play. Personally, I enjoy playing each villain first with purely random market cards (gems, relics, and spells). If we are defeated, we start custom choosing our market cards for the next attempt.

7. **The game never feels so complicated and fiddly that you need a notepad or app to track adjustments**. I mentioned Sentinels of the Multiverse as a comparison. SotM is known for its insane levels of fiddliness. Aeon's End does not have that sort of problem. Anything that needs to be tracked is easily done with tokens that go in their required place, and is not complicated. You may find, at most, that you just need to do a minor adjustment or two to your spells' damage levels which can easily be monitored.

8. **Each game takes roughly an hour**. And that's definitely a plus for this type of game. You can easily get in 1-3 sessions in a night. I enjoy this more than say Year 7 of Harry Potter where I have to go through all 7 years of villains in order to beat the final year.

9. **Replayability is not super high**. I don't see myself playing nemeses again and again. Perhaps, after I beat them all, I may try to beat the more fun ones on their advanced difficulty setting, but I'm not even sure about that. This game is fun, but it doesn't get my blood boiling for more plays. I bought this wanting to try a new type of deckbuilder, and bought expansions because there is a guy in my group who LOVES it. There are lots of small ways to tweak a nemesis more to your preference. If you want an easier game or a harder game, you can also adjust HP of the nemesis or city or even heroes.

10. **There is a legacy version coming out later this year.** If you are interested in the game, but want something even more unique, you might consider waiting for that. If you decide to buy AE or WE now, they are compatible with the legacy game. The legacy game is semi-resettable) you need a pack. 

I hope this helps if you're considering buying this. Next week we'll discuss Twilight Struggle!

**Description from Boardgamegeek**:

In many ways 7 Wonders Duel resembles its parent game 7 Wonders as over three ages players acquire cards that provide resources or advance their military or scientific development in order to develop a civilization and complete wonders.

What's different about 7 Wonders Duel is that, as the title suggests, the game is solely for two players, with the players not drafting cards simultaneously from hands of cards, but from a display of face-down and face-up cards arranged at the start of a round. A player can take a card only if it's not covered by any others, so timing comes into play as well as bonus moves that allow you to take a second card immediately. As in the original game, each card that you acquire can be built, discarded for coins, or used to construct a wonder.

Each player starts with four wonder cards, and the construction of a wonder provides its owner with a special ability. Only seven wonders can be built, though, so one player will end up short.

Players can purchase resources at any time from the bank, or they can gain cards during the game that provide them with resources for future building; as you acquire resources, the cost for those particular resources increases for your opponent, representing your dominance in this area.

A player can win 7 Wonders Duel in one of three ways: each time you acquire a military card, you advance the military marker toward your opponent's capital, giving you a bonus at certain positions; if you reach the opponent's capital, you win the game immediately; similarly, if you acquire any six of seven different scientific symbols, you achieve scientific dominance and win immediately; if none of these situations occurs, then the player with the most points at the end of the game wins.

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description from Boardgamegeek&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many ways 7 Wonders Duel resembles its parent game 7 Wonders as over three ages players acquire cards that provide resources or advance their military or scientific development in order to develop a civilization and complete wonders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s different about 7 Wonders Duel is that, as the title suggests, the game is solely for two players, with the players not drafting cards simultaneously from hands of cards, but from a display of face-down and face-up cards arranged at the start of a round. A player can take a card only if it&amp;#39;s not covered by any others, so timing comes into play as well as bonus moves that allow you to take a second card immediately. As in the original game, each card that you acquire can be built, discarded for coins, or used to construct a wonder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each player starts with four wonder cards, and the construction of a wonder provides its owner with a special ability. Only seven wonders can be built, though, so one player will end up short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Players can purchase resources at any time from the bank, or they can gain cards during the game that provide them with resources for future building; as you acquire resources, the cost for those particular resources increases for your opponent, representing your dominance in this area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A player can win 7 Wonders Duel in one of three ways: each time you acquire a military card, you advance the military marker toward your opponent&amp;#39;s capital, giving you a bonus at certain positions; if you reach the opponent&amp;#39;s capital, you win the game immediately; similarly, if you acquire any six of seven different scientific symbols, you achieve scientific dominance and win immediately; if none of these situations occurs, then the player with the most points at the end of the game wins.&lt;/p&gt;

Recently my wife and I have been looking for ways to trim down the collection as well as procure some fodder for upcoming Math Trades. We have gone through many different methods in order to remove some of the games in our collection, but have come to enjoy one in particular.

This method I'll call the 5 In A Row Challenge. I originally read about it from someone else on this sub who mentioned it as a way to remove games from their collection (credit goes to them entirely, this is just a reporting of our experience). We were skeptical at first, but then we decided to try it.

The 5 In A Row Challenge is simply a gauntlet of 5 plays of the same game in a row (over multiple play sessions). For example, we played 7 Wonders: Duel as the first candidate for the challenge. We played it 3 times the first day and 2 more times another day. The only stipulation is that you can't play anything other than the selected game until you're finished with the 5 plays.

The game fails the challenge if at any time while you're playing the game you think to yourself ""I don't want to play this again..."" Oppositely the game passes if it makes it through the 5 play gauntlet if you never think the above statement.

This all stems from my (perhaps unpopular) opinion that there is no point in owning games that you wouldn't want to play all the time.

So what does this do? The 5 In A Row Challenge allows me to quickly see which games should really belong in my collection. Obviously YMMV depending on your circumstances, but it works very well for us (we can't all play TI4 whenever we want to, or even 5 times in a row for that matter).

It also allows you to delve more deeply into the strategy involved with the game you're currently playing. Example: My wife and I put Abyss on the list just yesterday and actually had the time to crank out 5 games in about 2 hours. After the third game, I began to see common aspects in the winning strategies that were used across the games. We'd played the game 9 times before this already, but this was new to me. It was a cool experience to see an overarching strategy emerge from our multiple play sessions. As a result, we both became better players of the game. This probably would not have happened if we had played Abyss over the course of a few months interspersed with other games. The raw exposure allowed us to learn new tactics and strategies.

I just thought I'd throw this out there. Has anyone else tried anything similar to this and achieved similar results?

EDIT 1: It has been brought to my attention (and I agree) that this largely only applies to games that are on the lighter side. 

EDIT 2/Rant: I haven't changed the original text because I guess I've learned that I'm just more tolerant relative to everyone else. I don't get burned out playing a game multiple times. Every game in my collection has seen more than 5 plays because it deserves that many (or more). I have no shelf of shame because it's a waste. You could grab any game in my collection and (given that we had the time and player count to play it) I would play it, no hesitation. But all in all, to each his own. It's part of being in a hobby, you get to define how you enjoy it :)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey all!&lt;/p&gt;

That got me thinking:&lt;/p&gt;

Descent features story-driven encounters that will find the heroes exploring caves, dungeons, ruins, and engaging in battle against numerous monsters and enemies controlled by the overlord.

This game looks deadly in many respects, but my one big concern is lack of significant replayability. The Realm of Knowledge card pool isn't too extensive. Has anyone played on Tabletopia, or any other way, and can comment? It just seems like before long you'd be seeing the same sort of combo appear over and over.

Since the win condition really centers on dealing damage, I'm not sure about the general argument that you can experiment with lots of different play styles. Defensive cards could be handy in the moment, but isn't running one kind of just a stall tactic? Like, eventually you have to ditch that style and just shard up the most efficient damage cards before other ppl do, no?

Maybe a TLDR is that it seems a bit to easily ""solvable""?

My current one is “to provide students of (my school) with a fun environment to play board games and meet new friends.” I have a decent sized &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/e4GMnpk.jpg""&gt;collection &lt;/a&gt; so I’m not worried about acquiring the games as much as teaching so many new people so many new games. Advice?

Happy Tuesday, /r/boardgames!

This is a weekly thread to discuss train games and 18xx games, which are a family of economic train games consisting of shared ownership in railroad companies. For more information, [see the description on BGG](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamefamily/19/18xx). There’s also a subreddit devoted entirely to 18xx games, /r/18xx, and a subreddit devoted entirely to **[Age of Steam](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/4098/age-steam)**, /r/AgeOfSteam.

Here’s a nice guide on [how to get started with 18xx](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/4sygx3/how_to_get_started_with_18xx/?st=iqny4loj&amp;sh=c01b5d88).

Feel free to discuss anything about train games, including recent plays, what you're looking forward to, and any questions you have. 

If you want to arrange to play some 18xx or other train games online, feel free to try to arrange a game with people via /r/playboardgames.

While I love Blood Rage, I think the game gets hurt in the variety department by containing some very underpowered cards that rarely ever get drafted in its limited card pool.

Since board games can't benefit from timely updates for balance changes like online games, I've come up with a few ideas on how to change them so they're still low tier but fullfil their respective niches better. I'm also trying to change the Dwarf Chieftain and the Soldier of Hel into more interesting cards, as they provide no combos and are just free stat sticks. Besides those 2, it seems the general consensus for the worst offenders in the game are:

​

# AGE 1

* **Thor's Glory**  (Cost 2 **-** Gain 2 glory whenever at least 2 enemy figures are destroyed in a battle you participate in.)  
This card is awful because it costs at least 33% of your rage in Age 1 (likely more since some will be siphoned out by Loki), takes up a clan upgrade slot and provides a rather marginal (and very conditional!) benefit. It needs to trigger 3 times to beat out an Age 1 quest, while costing rage to play (on the Age you'll likely need it most), being arguably harder to trigger and not advancing a clan stat.  
*My suggestion: Making the upgrade* ***cost only 1 rage and upping the reward to 3 glory***. *It should give some legs to the card into the late game and tie in nicely with Valkirie, which is another card that can afford a little help through sinergy.*  

* **Tyr's Domain**  (Cost 0 **-**  After you reveal a quest card in combat, you may treat it as a +3 battle card.)  
To play this you'll lose a turn in Age 1, have to draft more quests instead of potentially more useful cards and if you win the battle you played the quest in you'll end up losing your quest card, not to mention this takes up a clan upgrade slot. All of that for turning quests into mediocre battle cards.  
*My suggestion:* **Make it cost 2, but give it a rather powerful extra effect - you get to keep the quest card used as a +3 battle card even if you win the battle.** *This makes it so you take a significant hit in rage at age 1 in exchange for a lot of future flexibility regarding your draft in the next 2 ages. It is also still susceptible to being countered by the card canceling battle cards in Age 2 and 3, and forces you to reveal at least one quest in your hand. Credits to* /u/MicromegaX.  

* **Dwarf Chieftain**  (Cost 2\* **-**  \*Costs no rage to upgrade or invade.)The Chieftain is a very decent monster, but it's also quite bland. In a game that's all about combos, it has pretty much 0 sinergy with anything else. Having a retail copy of the game, I'd like to fill up the spot left vacant by the Mountain Giant, as he increases the value in the ""lord"" line of cards, which are generally mid-to-low tier.  
*My suggestion: Rather than straight up proxying the Mountain Giant, I'd like this little dude to* ***cost 2 rage, have 2 STR and count as a leader***. *This is thematic - Dwarf CHIEFTAIN counts as a weaker leader and also has a nice parallel with how the Hydra is a stronger boat in Age 1. The reduction in cost is offset by the weaker STR for the rest of the game and better enables use of the overcosted Lord of Hammers without having to mess with that card as well.*  

* **Lord of Hammers  (Cost 3** \- If you successfully pillage with your leader, you may move him to an adjacent province.)  
While this might net a nice tempo gain, the cost in the first Age is ridiculous for the effect.  
*My suggestion:* **lowering the cost down to 2** *along with having a second leader in the game should help this see some fringe play.*  
 

# 

# AGE 2

There's nothing really egregious about Age 2, I feel it is the best balanced in the game.

​

&amp;#x200B;

# AGE 3

* **Völur Witch**  (Cost 3 - May retreat from an outer province to Yggdrasil instead of being destroyed.)  
Simply costs too much for what it does, even though what it does can certainly be useful for draining opponent's battle cards.  
*My suggestion: I'd like to take a page out of the scrapped design for the Mystic Troll and make this* ***cost 2 rage, have 2 STR, but provide 1 bonus STR for up to 4 of your warriors in the same province***. *This means that accompanied by no warriors it's strictly worse than the already middling monster Soldier of Hel (since the Witch would cost 1 rage), but it also has a higher ceiling, particularly for Yggdrasil battles, where it can potentially provide 6 strength. This is also rather thematic, as the Volur Witch can be thought of as giving bloodlust to your warriors.*  

* **Tyr's Wrath (Cost 1** \- After you reveal a quest card in combat, you may treat it as a +5 battle card.)  
This manages to be even worse than it's first age cousin, if only because there are so many better options in the third age and the action economy is even more valuable because this age tends to end quickly. Also worth noting that third age quests are worth tons of points, so if this is going to see play it needs to provide a more powerful effect.  
*My suggestion: Make it* ***cost 0 rage, make the quest count as a +3 battle card that can be used after battle cards are revealed****. Still not sure this would be enough to make it see play.*  

* **Soldier of Hel** (Cost 3\* - \*Costs no rage to upgrade or invade.)  
Like the Dwarf Chieftain, this dude is OK (actually worse than his Dwarven friend as he offers only a +1 STR a full 2 ages later), but he's rather bland and offers no sinergy.  
*My suggestion: Let's make this dude what the Volur Witch should have been from the start:* ***2 STR, costs no rage to invade and retreats to Yggdrasil rather than being destroyed***. *With no cost and 2 STR he'll be better suited for losing battles and draining your opponent's battle cards. Quite thematic that this zombie-like figure refuses to stay dead and springs forth from Yggdrasil time and time again.*

I would like some experienced BR players to chime in on what I'm doing with these cards balance wise. Did I go too far, did I not push hard enough. Please let me know!

&lt;em&gt;My suggestion: I&amp;#39;d like to take a page out of the scrapped design for the Mystic Troll and make this&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;cost 2 rage, have 2 STR, but provide 1 bonus STR for up to 4 of your warriors in the same province&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;em&gt;This means that accompanied by no warriors it&amp;#39;s strictly worse than the already middling monster Soldier of Hel (since the Witch would cost 1 rage), but it also has a higher ceiling, particularly for Yggdrasil battles, where it can potentially provide 6 strength. This is also rather thematic, as the Volur Witch can be thought of as giving bloodlust to your warriors.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tyr&amp;#39;s Wrath (Cost 1&lt;/strong&gt; - After you reveal a quest card in combat, you may treat it as a +5 battle card.)&lt;br/&gt;
This manages to be even worse than it&amp;#39;s first age cousin, if only because there are so many better options in the third age and the action economy is even more valuable because this age tends to end quickly. Also worth noting that third age quests are worth tons of points, so if this is going to see play it needs to provide a more powerful effect.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;em&gt;My suggestion: Make it&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;cost 0 rage, make the quest count as a +3 battle card that can be used after battle cards are revealed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;. Still not sure this would be enough to make it see play.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Soldier of Hel&lt;/strong&gt; (Cost 3* - *Costs no rage to upgrade or invade.)&lt;br/&gt;
Like the Dwarf Chieftain, this dude is OK (actually worse than his Dwarven friend as he offers only a +1 STR a full 2 ages later), but he&amp;#39;s rather bland and offers no sinergy.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;em&gt;My suggestion: Let&amp;#39;s make this dude what the Volur Witch should have been from the start:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;2 STR, costs no rage to invade and retreats to Yggdrasil rather than being destroyed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;em&gt;With no cost and 2 STR he&amp;#39;ll be better suited for losing battles and draining your opponent&amp;#39;s battle cards. Quite thematic that this zombie-like figure refuses to stay dead and springs forth from Yggdrasil time and time again.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;​&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve been in the hobby for about 4 years now, and the first games I bought were Ticket to Ride and Carcassonne after playing them at a friend’s house. I was immediately hooked after seeing the depth of gaming that I was missing out on having only been raised on games like Monopoly and Sorry. 

One thing I plan on changing is building a built in shelf system for this wall specifically for the growing collection. That and I’ll probably pare down the collection more in the future as new games replace ones that don’t hit the table anymore. 

Our current favorites are Everdell and Raiders of the North Sea. 

I can get pretty obsessed with organization, so a large number of these have third party game inserts, with Lords of Waterdeep and Scythe being the most upgraded of the collection. 

Anyway, just wanted to share with the community - thanks for being awesome!

So I wanted to know what the etiquette is regarding feeling physically drained and not wanting to continue playing. Should I simply end the game by helping another player win or should I simply explain how I feel and bow out?

** Feel free to just simply answer without the following context. **

About a month ago, I was at a local all-day board gaming event called GenCan't. The second game I got into was Lords Of Hellas. I had heard people talking about it before. Couldn't remember the context. But I wanted to play to get that experience. I think it was a good half an hour to forty five minute explanation of the rules, which didn't really help to explain anything. 

You know when you understand the words that the person said, but you're still lost in the process of gameplay? Anyways, cut to three hours later, and I don't feel good. I hate long games and I especially hate long games with long turn delays. (It was more than ten minutes between each turn at this point.) 

I am feeling like I physically just do not want to be here. I don't care that I'm not winning. I don't really even care that I could maybe win. I try to just for the sake of good gamesmanship, but that gets shut down pretty easily. I think three of our four monuments were completed to about half. I'm not in territory for any of them. I'm to the left of Sparta and the nearest monument is in the neighboring territory. Two guys seem to be winning with the owner of the game being in the lead. Neither of them can clinch it. I'm stuck with little to no chance and the person that has the nearest monument to me doesn't seem to be on-point with their strategy. 

I realize that I can probably shut the game down by ending the whole turn order and building the monument to 3/4s in that guy's territory. Then when it gets back around to my turn, doing it again to complete it off.

I agonize for the next fifteen minutes on which is better etiquette: to walk away or just complete the monument. I'm getting more and more drained so I just figured I'll complete the monument and make a half-assed effort to try and be in the territory to maybe possibly win.

45 minutes later, before I can do that, the owner of the game wins by slaying his &lt;x&gt;th monster and I'm done. Completely solidified how I absolutely despise long turn delays.

Thanks for your inquiry.  Saboteur is not out of print.  It is currently shipping through new distributors and will be back in stores, including Barnes &amp; Noble, over the next couple months.  AMIGO will also be selling it on Amazon by end of year.

If you tell me where you live, I can look up which stores in your area will have it in stock.""

Don't pay premium - wait and you can get it in the sub 10$ range.

Some random thoughts I had were for Scar and Madam Mim. 

For Madam Mim I’m thinking her goal should be to defeat Merlin in a wizard’s duel by defeating all his animal forms. But Madam Mim wouldn’t have allies, instead she’d have a new card type called “form” or something like that. She could only have one form on the board at a time and the form would follow her when she moved locations, giving some benefit, maybe each form would give a different action. But forms would be used to defeat specific forms of Merlin. Like Cat form would defeat Mouse Merlin, or Rhino form would defeat Turtle Merlin. I think Purple Dragon form might be able to defeat any Merlin Form. 

Then you discard your form to defeat a specific Merlin and the Merlins are removed from the game and once you defeat all his forms, maybe 4-5, you win. 

Mim could also have an effect card called “Disappear” which could work the same way as Maleficent’s “Vanish” or maybe some different way. And she’d need ways to get into the fate deck and look for heroes. 

For Scar his goal could be to defeat adult Simba at Pride Rock. The thing would be that Simba is a double sided card. He starts on Young Simba side who cannot be defeated, but moves location one to the right each turn as Simba makes his way around the board from Pride Rock to the Watering Hole to the Elephant Graveyard. When Mufasa is  defeated, it flips Simba over and he becomes Adult Simba who acts like a regular hero and immediately moves Adult Simba to the spot furthest from Pride Rock.

What do you value more quality or price?

I am currently developing a game called Curators that I intend to release on Kickstarter in April. The game is a medium light tile building euro with a new action selection mechanism involving poker like chips.

The problem I am facing is what material I should go for with the chips. For quality I think the best shot would be real poker chips but that would make the game immensely expensive. So there for I am currently thinking plastic or card board. What would you prefer a game that costs $65 with real poker chips or something with cardboard or plastic that cost $40. 

Thanks for your opinions.

Dining tables are obviously easier to play games at, but I tend to like to curl up or bring my feet up, which makes a couch and coffee table more comfortable.
